<h2>A. Introduction</h2>

<p>
	Prayer has both aids and witnesses which make the steep
	ascent more gentle and more sure, easing the pain of fear and
	offering the comfort and the promises of hope. Forgivenessʹs
	witness and an aid to prayer, a giver of assurance of success in
	ultimate attainment of the goal, is healing. Its importance should
	not be too strongly emphasised, for healing is a sign or symbol of
	forgivenessʹs strength, and only an effect or shadow of a change of
	mind about the goal of prayer.
</p>

<h2 id="b">B. The Cause of Sickness</h2>

<p>
	Do not mistake effect for cause, nor think that sickness is
	apart and separate from what its cause must be. It is a sign, a
	shadow of an evil thought that seems to have reality and to be just,
	according to the usage of the world. It is external proof of inner
	‘sin’, and witnesses to unforgiving thoughts that injure and
	would hurt the Son of God. Healing the body is impossible, and
	this is shown by the brief nature of the ‘cure’. The body yet must
	die, and healing it is but a brief delay in its return to dust, where
	it was born and will go back.
</p>

<p>
	The bodyʹs source is unforgiveness of the Son of God. It
	has not left its source, and in its pain and aging and the mark of
	death upon it this is clearly shown. Fearful and frail it seems to be
	to those who think their life is tied to its command and linked to its
	unstable, tiny breath. Death stares at them as every moment goes
	irrevocably past their grasping hands, which cannot hold them back.
	And they feel fear as bodies change and sicken. For they sense the
	heavy scent of death upon their hearts.
</p>

<p>
	The body can be healed as an effect of true forgiveness.
	Only that can give remembrance of immortality, which is the gift
	of holiness and love. Forgiveness must be given by a mind which
	understands that it must overlook all shadows on the holy face of
	Christ, among which sickness should be seen as one. Nothing but
	that; the sign of judgment made by brother upon brother, and the
	Son of God upon himself. For he has damned his body as his
	prison, and forgot that it is he who gave this role to it.
</p>

<p>
	What he has done now must Godʹs Son undo. But not alone.
	For he has thrown away the prisonʹs key; his holy sinlessness and
	the remembrance of his Fatherʹs Love. Yet Help is given to him in
	the Voice his Father placed in him. The power to heal is now his
	Fatherʹs gift, for through His Voice He still can reach His Son,
	reminding him the body may become his chosen home, but it will
	never be his home in truth.
</p>

<h2 id="c">C. False versus True Healing</h2>

<p>
	Distinctions therefore must be made between true healing
	and its faulty counterpart. The world of opposites is healingʹs place,
	for what in Heaven could there be to heal? As prayer within the
	world can ask amiss and seeming charity forgive to kill, so healing
	can be false as well as true; a witness to the power of the world or to
	the everlasting Love of God.
</p>

<p>
	False healing merely makes a poor exchange of one
	illusion for a ‘nicer’ one; a dream of sickness for a dream of health.
	This can occur at lower forms of prayer, combining with forgiveness
	kindly meant but not completely understood as yet. Only false
	healing can give way to fear, so sickness will be apt to strike
	again. False healing can indeed remove a form of pain and sickness.
	But the cause remains, and will not lack effects. The cause is still the
	wish to die and overcome the Christ. And with this wish is death a
	certainty, for prayer <em>is</em> answered. Yet there is a kind of seeming
	death that has a different source. It does not come because of
	hurtful thoughts and raging anger at the universe. It merely
	signifies the end has come for usefulness of body functioning. And
	so it is discarded as a choice, as one lays by a garment now
	outworn.
</p>

<p>
	This is what death should be; a quiet choice, made joyfully
	and with a sense of peace, because the body has been kindly used to
	help the Son of God along the way he goes to God. We thank the
	body, then, for all the service it has given us. But we are thankful,
	too, the need is done to walk the world of limits, and to reach the
	Christ in hidden forms and clearly seen at most in lovely flashes.
	Now we can behold Him without blinders, in the light that we
	have learned to look upon again.
</p>

<p>
	We call it death, but it is liberty. It does not come in forms
	that seem to be thrust down in pain upon unwilling flesh, but as a
	gentle welcome to release. If there has been true healing, this can be
	the form in which death comes when it is time to rest a while from
	labour gladly done and gladly ended. Now we go in peace to freër
	air and gentler climate, where it is not hard to see the gifts we gave
	were saved for us. For Christ is clearer now; His vision more
	sustained in us; His Voice, the Word of God, more certainly our
	own.
</p>

<p>
	This gentle passage to a higher prayer, a kind forgiveness of
	the ways of earth, can only be received with thankfulness. Yet first
	true healing must have come to bless the mind with loving pardon
	for the sins it dreamed about and laid upon the world. Now are its
	dreams dispelled in quiet rest. Now its forgiveness comes to heal
	the world and it is ready to depart in peace, the journey over and
	the lessons learned.
</p>

<p>
	This is not death according to the world, for death is cruel in
	its frightened eyes and takes the form of punishment for sin. How
	could it be a blessing, then, and how could it be welcome when it
	must be feared? What healing has occurred in such a view of what
	is merely opening the gate to higher prayer and kindly justice done?
	Death is reward and not a punishment. But such a viewpoint must
	be fostered by the healing that the world cannot conceive. There is
	no partial healing. What but shifts illusions has done nothing.
	What is false cannot be partly true. If you are healed your healing is
	complete. Forgiveness is the only gift you give and would receive.
</p>

<p>
	False healing rests upon the bodyʹs cure, leaving the cause
	of illness still unchanged, ready to strike again until it brings a cruel
	death in seeming victory. It can be held at bay a little while, and
	there can be brief respite as it waits to take its vengeance on the Son
	of God. Yet it cannot be overcome until all faith in it has been laid
	by, and placed upon Godʹs substitute for evil dreams; a world
	in which there is no veil of sin to keep it dark and comfortless. At
	last the gate of Heaven opens and Godʹs Son is free to enter in the
	home that stands ready to welcome him, and was prepared before
	time was and still but waits for him.
</p>

<h2 id="d">D. Separation versus Union</h2>

<p>
	False healing heals the body in a part, but never as a whole.
	Its separate goals become quite clear in this, for it has not removed
	the curse of sin that lies on it. Therefore it still deceives. Nor is it
	made by one who understands the other is exactly like himself, for it
	is this that makes true healing possible. When false, there is some
	power that another has, not equally bestowed on both as one. Here
	is the separation shown. And here the meaning of true healing has
	been lost, and idols have arisen to obscure the unity that is the Son
	of God.
</p>

<p>
	Healing‐to‐separate may seem to be a strange idea. Yet it
	can be said of any form of healing that is based on inequality of any
	kind. These forms may heal the body, and indeed are generally
	limited to this. Someone knows better, has been better trained, or is
	perhaps more talented and wise. Therefore, he can give healing to
	the one who stands beneath him in his patronage. The healing of
	the body can be done by this because, in dreams, equality cannot be
	permanent. The shifts and change are what the dream is made of.
	To be healed appears to be to find a wiser one who, by his arts and
	learning, will succeed.
</p>

<p>
	Someone knows better; this the magic phrase by which the
	body seems to be the aim of healing as the world conceives of it.
	And to this wiser one another goes to profit by his learning and his
	skill; to find in him the remedy for pain. How can that be? True
	healing cannot come from inequality assumed and then accepted as
	the truth, and used to help restore the wounded and to calm the
	mind that suffers from the agony of doubt.
</p>

<p>
	Is there a role for healing, then, that one can use to offer
	help for someone else? In arrogance the answer must be “No”.
	Yet in humility there is indeed a place for helpers. It is like the
	role that helps in prayer, and lets forgiveness be what it is meant to
	be. You do not make yourself the bearer of the special gift that
	brings the healing. You but recognise your oneness with the one
	who calls for help. For in this oneness is his separate sense
	dispelled, and it was this that made him sick. There is no point in
	giving remedy apart from where the source of sickness is, for never
	thus can it be truly healed.
</p>

<p>
	Healers there are, for they are Sons of God who recognise
	their Source, and understand that all their Source creates is one with
	them. This is the remedy that brings relief which cannot fail. It will
	remain to bless for all eternity. It heals no part, but wholly and
	forever. Now the cause of every malady has been revealed exactly
	as it is. And in that place is written now the holy Word of
	God. Sickness and separation must be healed by love and union.
	Nothing else can heal as God established healing. Without Him
	there is no healing, for there is no love.
</p>

<p>
	Godʹs Voice alone can tell you how to heal. Listen, and you
	will never fail to bring His kindly remedy to those He sends to you,
	to let Him heal them, and to bless all those who serve with Him in
	healingʹs name. The bodyʹs healing will occur because its cause has
	gone. And now without a cause, it cannot come again in different
	form. Nor will death any more be feared because it has been
	understood. There is no fear in one who has been truly healed, for
	love has entered now where idols used to stand, and fear has given
	way at last to God.
</p>

<h2 id="e">E. The Holiness of Healing</h2>

<p>
	How holy are the healed! For in their sight their brothers
	share their healing and their love. Bringers of peace — the Holy
	Spiritʹs voice, through whom He speaks for God, Whose Voice He
	is ‐ such are Godʹs healers. They but speak for Him and never for
	themselves. They have no gifts but those they have from God. And
	these they share because they know that this is what He wills. They
	are not special. They are holy. They have chosen holiness, and
	given up all separate dreams of special attributes through which
	they can bestow unequal gifts on those less fortunate. Their healing
	has restored their wholeness so they can forgive, and join the song
	of prayer in which the healed sing of their union and their thanks to
	God.
</p>

<p>
	As witness to forgiveness, aid to prayer, and the effect of
	mercy truly taught, healing is blessing. And the world responds in
	quickened chorus through the voice of prayer. Forgiveness shines
	its merciful reprieve upon each blade of grass and feathered wing
	and all the living things upon the earth. Fear has no haven here, for
	love has come in all its holy oneness. Time remains only to let the
	last embrace of prayer rest on the earth an instant, as the world is
	shined away. This instant is the goal of all true healers, whom the
	Christ has taught to see His likeness and to teach like Him.
</p>

<p>
	Think what it means to help the Christ to heal! Can anything
	be holier than this? God thanks His healers, for He knows the
	Cause of healing is Himself, His Love, His Son, restored as His
	completion and returned to share with Him creationʹs holy joy. Do
	not ask partial healing, nor accept an idol for remembrance of
	Him Whose Love has never changed and never will. You are as
	dear to Him as is the whole of His creation, for it is in you as His
	eternal gift. What need have you for shifting dreams within a sorry
	world? Do not forget the gratitude of God. Do not forget the holy
	grace of prayer. Do not forget forgiveness of Godʹs Son.
</p>

<p>
	You first forgive, then pray, and you are healed. Your
	prayer has risen up and called to God, Who hears and answers. You
	have understood that you forgive yourself and pray for you and
	in this understanding you are healed. In prayer you have united
	with your Source, and understood that you have never left. This
	level cannot be attained until there is no hatred in your heart, and
	no desire to attack the Son of God. Never forget this; it is you who
	are Godʹs Son, and as you choose to be to him so are you to yourself,
	and God to you.
</p>

<p>
	Nor will your judgement fail to reach to God, for you will
	give the role to Him you see in His creation. Thus have you become
	‘creator’ in His place, and He becomes no longer Cause but
	only an effect. Now healing is impossible, for on Him lies the
	blame for your deception and your guilt. He Who is Love is
	now the source of fear, and only fear can now be justified.
	Vengeance is His. His great destroyer, death. And sickness,
	suffering and grievous loss become the lot of everyone on earth,
	which He abandoned to the devilʹs care, swearing He will deliver it
	no more.
</p>

<p>
	Come unto Me, My children, once again, without such
	twisted thoughts upon your heart. You still are holy with the
	Holiness which fathered you in perfect sinlessness, and still
	surrounds you in the arms of peace. Dream now of healing. Then
	arise and lay all dreaming down forever. You are he your
	Father loves, who never left his home, nor wandered in a savage
	world with feet that bleed, and with a heavy heart made hard
	against the Love that is the truth in you. Give all your dreams to
	Christ and let Him be your Guide to healing, leading you in prayer
	beyond the sorry reaches of the world.
</p>

<p>
	He comes for Me and speaks My Word to you. I would
	recall My weary Son to Me from dreams of malice to the sweet
	embrace of everlasting Love and perfect peace. My arms are open
	to the Son I love, who does not understand that he is healed, and
	that his prayer has never ceased to sing his joyful thanks in unison
	with all creation, in the holiness of God. Be still an instant.
	Underneath the sounds of harsh and bitter striving and defeat there
	is a Voice that speaks to you of Me. Hear this an instant and you
	will be healed. Hear this an instant and you have been saved.
</p>

<p>
	Help Me to wake My children from the dream of retribution
	and a little life beset with fear, that ends so soon it might as well
	have never been. Let Me instead remind you of eternity, in which
	your joy grows greater as your love extends along with Mine
	beyond infinity, where time and distance have no meaning. While
	you wait in sorrow Heavenʹs melody is incomplete, because your
	song is part of the eternal harmony of love. Without you is creation
	incomplete. Return to Me Who never left His Son.
</p>

<p>
	Listen, My child, Your Father calls to you. Do not refuse to
	hear the call of Love. Do not deny to Christ what is His Own.
	Heaven is here and Heaven is your home. Creation leans across the
	bars of time to lift the heavy burden from the world. Lift up your
	hearts to greet its advent. See the shadows fade away in gentleness;
	the thorns fall softly from the bleeding brow of him who is the holy
	Son of God. How lovely are you, Child of Holiness! How like to
	Me! How lovingly I hold you in My heart and in My arms. How
	dear is every gift that you have given Me, who healed My Son and
	took him from the cross.
</p>

<p>
	Arise and let My thanks be given you. And with My
	gratitude will come the gift first of forgiveness, then eternal peace.
	So now return your holy voice to Me. The song of prayer is
	silent without you. The universe is waiting your release because it
	is its own. Be kind to it and to yourself, and then be kind to Me. I
	ask but this; that you be comforted and live no more in terror and in
	pain. Do not abandon Love. Remember this; whatever you may
	think about yourself, whatever you may think about the world, your
	Father needs you and will call to you until you come to Him in
	peace at last.
</p>
