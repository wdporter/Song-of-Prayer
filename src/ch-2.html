<h2>A. Introduction</h2>

<p>
	Forgiveness offers wings to prayer, to make its rising easy
	and its progress swift. Without its strong support it would be vain
	to try to rise above the bottom step, or even to attempt to climb at
	all. Forgiveness is prayerʹs ally; sister in the plan for your salvation.
	Both must come to hold you up and keep your feet secure; your
	purpose steadfast and unchangeable. Behold the greatest help that
	God ordained to be with you until you reach to Him. Illusionʹs end
	will come with this. Unlike the timeless nature of its sister prayer,
	forgiveness has an end, for it becomes unneeded when the rising up
	is done. Yet now it has a purpose beyond which you cannot go, nor
	have you need to go. Accomplish this and you have been
	redeemed. Accomplish this and you have been transformed.
	Accomplish this and you will save the world.
</p>

<h2 id="b">B. Forgiveness of Yourself</h2>

<p>
	No gift of Heaven has been more misunderstood than has
	forgiveness. It has, in fact, become a scourge; a curse where it was
	meant to bless, a cruel mockery of grace, a parody upon the holy
	peace of God. Yet those who have not yet elected to begin the
	steps of prayer cannot but use it thus. Forgivenessʹs kindness is
	obscure at first, because salvation is not understood, <em>nor truly sought for</em>.
	What was meant to heal is used to hurt because
	forgiveness is not wanted. Guilt becomes salvation, and the remedy
	appears to be a terrible alternative to life.
</p>

<p>
	Forgiveness‐to‐destroy will therefore suit the purpose of the
	world far better than its true objective, and the honest means by
	which this goal is reached. Forgiveness‐to‐destroy will overlook no
	sin, no crime, no guilt that it can find and ‘love’. Dear to its heart
	is error, and mistakes loom large and grow and swell within its
	sight. It carefully picks out all evil things, and overlooks the loving
	as a plague; a hateful thing of danger and of death. Forgiveness‐to‐
	destroy <em>is</em> death, and this it sees in everything it looks
	upon and hates. Godʹs mercy has become a twisted knife that
	would destroy the holy Son He loves.
</p>

<p>
	Would you forgive yourself for doing this? Then learn that
	God has given you a means by which you can return to Him in
	peace. <em>Do not see error.</em> Do not make it real. Select the loving
	and forgive the sin by choosing in its place the face of Christ. How
	otherwise can prayer return to God? He loves His Son. Can you
	remember Him and hate what He created? You will hate his Father
	if you hate the Son He loves. For as you see the Son you see
	yourself, and as you see yourself is God to you.
</p>

<p>
	As prayer is always for yourself, so is forgiveness given
	you. It is impossible to forgive another, for it is only your sins you
	see in him. You want to see them there, and not in you. That is why
	forgiveness of another is an illusion. Yet it is the only happy dream
	in all the world; the only one that does not lead to death. Only in
	someone else can you forgive yourself, for you have called him
	guilty of your sins, and in him must your innocence be found.
	Who but the sinful need to be forgiven? And do not ever think you
	can see sin in anyone except yourself.
</p>

<p>
	This is the great deception of the world, and you the great
	deceiver of yourself. It always seems to be another who is evil, and
	in his sin you are the injured one. How could freedom be possible if
	this were true? You would be slave to everyone, for what he does
	entails your fate, your feelings, your despair or hope, your misery or
	joy. You have no freedom unless he gives it to you. And being evil,
	he can only give of what he is. You cannot see his sins and not your
	own. But you can free him and yourself as well.
</p>

<p>
	Forgiveness, truly given, is the only way in which your
	hope of freedom lies. Others will make mistakes and so will you, as
	long as this illusion of a world appears to be your home. God has
	given all His Sons a remedy for all illusions that they think they see.
	Christʹs vision does not use your eyes, but you can look through His
	and learn to see like Him. Mistakes are tiny shadows, quickly gone,
	which for an instant only seem to hide the face of Christ,
	which still remains unchanged behind them all. His constancy
	remains in tranquil silence and in perfect peace. He does not know
	of shadows. His the eyes that look past error to the Christ in you.
</p>

<p>
	Ask then His help, and ask Him how to learn forgiveness as
	His vision lets it be. You are in need of what He gives, and your
	salvation rests on learning this of Him. Prayer cannot be released to
	Heaven while forgiveness‐to‐destroy remains with you. Godʹs
	mercy would remove this withering and poisoned thinking from
	your holy mind. Christ has forgiven you, and in His sight the world
	is holy as Himself. Who sees no evil in it sees like Him, for what
	He has forgiven has not sinned, and guilt can be no more.
	Salvationʹs plan is made complete, and sanity has come.
</p>

<p>
	Forgiveness is the call to sanity, for who but the insane
	would look on sin when he could see the face of Christ instead?
	This is the choice you make; the simplest one, and yet the only one
	that you can make. God calls on you to save His Son from death by
	offering the love of Christ to him. This is your need, and God
	Himself holds out this gift to you. As He would give, so must you
	give as well. And thus is prayer restored to formlessness, beyond
	all limits into timelessness, with nothing of the past to hold it back
	from reüniting with the ceaseless song that all creation sings unto
	its God.
</p>

<p>
	But to achieve this end you first must learn, before you
	reach where learning cannot go. Forgiveness is the key, but who
	can use a key when he has lost the door for which the key was
	made, and where alone it fits? Therefore we make distinctions, so
	that prayer can be released from darkness into light.
	Forgivenessʹs role must be reversed, and cleansed from evil
	usages and hateful goals. Forgiveness‐to‐destroy must be unveiled
	in all its treachery, and then let go forever and forever. There can be
	no trace of it remaining, if the plan that God established for
	returning be achieved at last, and learning be complete.
</p>

<p>
	This is the world of opposites. And you must choose
	between them every instant while this world retains reality for you.
	Yet you must learn alternatives for choice, or you will not be able to
	attain your freedom. Let it then be clear to you exactly what
	forgiveness means to you, and learn what it should be to set you
	free. The level of your prayer depends on this, for here it waits its
	freedom to ascend above the world of chaos into peace.
</p>

<h2 id="c">C. Forgiveness‐to‐Destroy</h2>

<p>
	Forgiveness‐to‐destroy has many forms, being a weapon of
	the world of form. Not all of them are obvious, and some are
	carefully concealed beneath what seems like charity. Yet all the
	forms that it may take have but one goal; their purpose is to
	separate and make what God created equal, different. The
	difference is clear in several forms where the designed comparison
	cannot be missed, nor is it meant to be.
</p>

<p>
	In this group, first, there are the forms in which a ‘better’
	person deigns to stoop to save a baser one from what he is.
	Forgiveness here rests solely on the base of gracious lordliness so
	far from love that arrogance could never be dislodged. Who can
	forgive and yet despise? And who can tell another he is steeped in
	sin, and yet perceive him as the Son of God? Who makes a slave to
	teach what freedom is? There is no union here, but only grief. This
	is not mercy. This is death.
</p>

<p>
	Another form, still very like the first if it is understood, does
	not appear in quite such blatant arrogance. The one who would
	forgive the other does not claim to be the better. Now he
	merely says that here is one whose sinfulness he shares, since
	both have been unworthy and deserve the retribution of the wrath
	of God. This can appear to be a humble act, and can indeed
	become a rivalry in baseness and in guilt. It is not love for
	Godʹs creation and the holiness that is His gift forever. Can His Son
	condemn himself and still remember Him?
</p>

<p>
	Here the goal is to separate from God the Son He loves, and
	keep him from his Source. This goal is also sought by those who
	seek the role of martyr at anotherʹs hand. Here must the aim be
	clearly seen, for this may pass as meekness and as charity instead of
	cruelty. Is it not kind to be accepting of anotherʹs spite, and not
	respond except with silence and a gentle smile? Behold, how good
	are you who bear with patience and with saintliness the anger and
	the hurt another gives, and do not show the bitter pain you feel.
</p>

<p>
	Forgiveness‐to‐destroy will often hide behind a cloak like
	this. It shows the face of suffering and pain, in silent proof of guilt
	and of the ravages of sin. Such is the witness that it offers one who
	could be saviour, not an enemy. But having made him enemy, he
	must accept the guilt and heavy‐laid reproach that thus is put upon
	him. Is this love? Or is it rather treachery to one who needs
	salvation from the pain of guilt? What is it for, except to keep the
	witnesses of guilt away from love?
</p>

<p>
	Forgiveness‐to‐destroy can also take the form of bargaining
	and compromise. ʺI will forgive you if you meet my needs, for in
	your slavery is my release”. Say this to anyone and you are slave.
	And you will seek to rid yourself of guilt in further bargains which
	can give no hope, but only greater pain and misery. How fearful
	has forgiveness now become, and how distorted is the end it seeks.
	Have mercy on yourself who bargained thus. God gives and does
	not ask for recompense. There is no giving but to give like Him. All
	else is mockery. For who would try to strike a bargain with the Son
	of God, and thank his Father for his holiness?
</p>

<p>
	What would you show your brother? Would you try to
	reïnforce his guilt and thus your own? Forgiveness is the means for
	your escape. How pitiful it is to make of it a means for further
	slavery and pain. Within the world of opposites there is a way to
	use forgiveness for the goal of God, and find the peace He offers
	you. Take nothing else, or you have sought your death, and prayed
	for separation from your Self. Christ is for all because He is in all.
	It is His face forgiveness lets you see. It is His face in which you
	see your own.
</p>

<p>
	All forms forgiveness takes that do not lead away from
	anger, condemnation, and comparisons of every kind are death. For
	that is what their purposes have set. Be not deceived by them, but
	lay them by as worthless in their tragic offerings. You do not want
	to stay in slavery. You do not want to be afraid of God. You want
	to see the sunlight and the glow of Heaven shining on the face of
	earth, redeemed from sin and in the Love of God. From here is
	prayer released, along with you. Your wings are free, and prayer
	will lift you up and bring you home where God would have you be.
</p>

<h2 id="d">D. Forgiveness‐for‐Salvation</h2>

<p>
	Forgiveness‐for‐salvation has one form, and only one. It
	does not ask for proof of innocence, nor pay of any kind. It does not
	argue, nor evaluate the errors that it wants to overlook. It does not
	offer gifts in treachery, nor promise freedom while it asks for death.
	Would God deceive you? He but asks for trust and willingness to
	learn how to be free. He gives His Teacher to whoëver asks, and
	seeks to understand the Will of God. His readiness to give lies far
	beyond your understanding and your simple grasp. Yet He has
	willed you learn the way to Him, and in His willing there is
	certainty.
</p>

<p>
	You Child of God, the gifts of God are yours, not by your
	plans but by His holy Will. His Voice will teach you what
	forgiveness is, and how to give it as He wills it be. Do not, then,
	seek to understand what is beyond you yet, but let it be a way to
	draw you up to where the sight of Christ becomes the eyes you
	choose. Give up all else, for there <em>is</em> nothing else. When someone
	calls for help in any form, He is the One to answer for you. All
	that you need do is to step back and not to interfere. Forgiveness‐for‐salvation
	is His task, and it is He Who will respond for you.
</p>

<p>
	Do not establish what the form should be that His
	forgiveness takes. He knows the way to make of every call a help to
	you, as you arise in haste to go at last unto your Fatherʹs house.
	He will direct your footsteps surely, and your words sincere;
	not with your own sincerity, but with His Own. Let Him take
	charge of how you would forgive, and each occasion then will be to
	you another step to Heaven and to peace.
</p>

<p>
	Are you not weary of imprisonment? God did not choose
	this sorry path for you. What you have chosen still can be undone,
	for prayer is merciful and God is just. His is a justice He can
	understand, but you cannot as yet. Yet will He give the means to
	you to learn of Him, and know at last that condemnation is not real
	and makes illusions in its evil name. And yet it matters not the form
	that dreams may seem to take. Illusions are untrue. Godʹs Will is
	truth, and you are one with Him in Will and purpose. Here all
	dreams are done.
</p>

<p>
	ʺWhat should I do for this, Your holy Son?ʺ should be the
	only thing you ever ask when help is needed and forgiveness
	sought. The form the seeking takes you need not judge. But let it
	not be you who sets the form in which forgiveness comes to save
	Godʹs Son. The light of Christ in him is his release, and it is this that
	answers to his call. Forgive him as the Christ decides you should,
	and be His eyes through which you look on him, and speak for Him
	as well. He knows the need; the question and the answer. He will
	say exactly what to do in words that you can understand and you
	can also use. Do not confuse His function with your own. He is the
	Answer; you the one who hears.
</p>

<p>
	And what is it He speaks to you about? About salvation
	and the gift of peace. About the end of sin and guilt and death.
	About the role forgiveness has in Him. Do you but listen, for He
	will be heard by anyone who calls upon His Name, and places
	his forgiveness in His hands. Forgiveness has been given Him to
	teach, to save it from destruction and to make the means for
	separation, sin and death become again the holy gift of love.
	Prayer is His Own right hand, made free to save as true forgiveness
	is allowed to come from His eternal vigilance and Love.
</p>

<p>
	Listen and learn, and do not judge. It is to God you turn
	to hear what you should do. His Answer will be clear as morning,
	nor is His forgiveness what you think it is. Still does He know, and
	that should be enough. Forgiveness has a Teacher Who will fail in
	nothing. Rest a while in this; do not attempt to judge forgiveness,
	nor to set it in an earthly frame. Let it arise to Christ, Who
	welcomes it as gift to Him. He will not leave you comfortless, nor
	fail to send His angels down to answer you in His Own Name. He
	stands beside the door to which forgiveness is the only key. Give it
	to Him to use instead of you, and you will see the door swing
	silently open upon the shining face of Christ. Behold your brother
	there beyond the door; the Son of God as He created him.
</p>
