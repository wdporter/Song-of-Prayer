<h2 id="a">A. Introduction</h2>

<p>
	Prayer is the greatest gift with which God blessed His Son
	at his creation. It was then what it is to become; the single Voice
	Creator and creation share; the song the Son sings to the Father,
	Who returns the thanks it offers Him unto the Son. Endless the
	harmony, and endless too the joyous concord of the Love They give
	forever to each other. And in this creation is extended. God gives
	thanks to His extension in His Son. His Son gives thanks for his
	creation, in the song of his creating in his Fatherʹs Name. The Love
	They share is what all prayer will be throughout eternity, when time
	is done. For such it was before time seemed to be.
</p>

<p>
	To you who are in time a little while, prayer takes the form
	that best will suit your need. You have but one. What God created
	one must recognise its oneness, and rejoice that what illusions
	seemed to separate is one forever in the Mind of God. Prayer now
	must be the means by which Godʹs Son leaves separate goals and
	separate interests by, and turns in holy gladness to the truth of
	union in his Father and himself.
</p>

<p>
	Lay down your dreams, you holy Son of God, and rising up
	as God created you, dispense with idols and remember Him. Prayer
	will sustain you now, and bless you as you lift your hearts to Him
	in rising song that reaches higher and then higher still until both
	high and low have disappeared. Faith in your goal will grow and
	hold you up as you ascend the shining stairway to the lawns of
	Heaven and the gate of peace. For this is prayer, and here salvation
	is. This is the way. It is Godʹs gift to you.
</p>

<p>
	Asking is holy, and it is holy because it is a way of reaching
	God. He is the Answerer because you are in need of an Answer.
	No‐one can ask for another and receive the Answer for him. But
	you can, and indeed you must, help him by offering your love and
	support that his answer be holy and his true need recognised. That
	is prayer; it is the same for yourself or for another. There is no
	difference. If you received the answers for another, there would be a
	difference.
</p>

<p>
	This does not mean that you cannot get messages for
	another, if it is God Who chooses this way of reaching him. This
	will usually happen unexpectedly, generally in the form of a sudden
	feeling that you have something to tell him; a message to deliver.
	You have not been wrong in the past about how you have asked,
	but you are ready for a step ahead now. There are joint decisions in
	which unanimity of response is a good indication of authenticity.
	This should not be abandoned. But asking is a lesson in trust, and
	noöne can trust for another. He can only strengthen another’s trust
	by offering it to him and having faith in his ability to hear for
	himself.
</p>

<p>
	Asking is the way to God because it offers us His Will as
	He would have us hear it. We will have a series of lessons on
	asking because you have not understood it. But do not think
	because of that that you have been mistaken in your attempts. You
	have done well and will do better.
</p>

<p>
	Any specific question involves a large number of
	assumptions which inevitably limit the answer. A specific question
	is actually a decision about the kind of answer that is acceptable.
	The purpose of words is to limit, and by limiting to make a vast area
	of experience more manageable. But that means manageable by
	<em>you</em>. For many aspects of living in this world that is necessary. But
	not for asking. God does not use words and does not answer in
	words. He can only ‘speak’ to the Christ in you, Who translates
	His Answer into whatever language you can understand and
	accept. Sometimes words will limit fear; sometimes not. That is
	why some people hear words, some receive feelings of inner
	conviction, and some do not become aware of anything. Yet God
	has answered, and His Answer will reach you when you are ready.
</p>

<p>
	Answers are not up to you. Any limit you place on them
	interferes with hearing. God’s Voice is silent and speaks in silence.
	That means that you do not phrase the question and you do not
	restrict the answer.
</p>

<p>
	Asking is prayer. It is not a demand. It is not questioning.
	It is not limitation. The only real request is for God’s Answer. It
	needs the humility of trust, not the arrogance of false certainty.
	Trust cannot lie in idols, for that is merely faith in magic. Trust
	requires faith that God understands, knows, and will answer. It
	means a state of peace. For this you can safely ask. In fact, if you
	do not feel that you have it, asking for it is the only real request
	you can make.
</p>

<h2 id="b">B. True Prayer</h2>

<p>
	Prayer is a way offered by the Holy Spirit to reach God. It
	is not merely a question or an entreaty. It cannot succeed until you
	realise that it asks for nothing. How else could it serve its purpose?
	It is impossible to pray for idols and hope to reach God. True
	prayer must avoid the pitfall of asking to entreat. Ask rather to
	receive what is already given; to accept what is already there.
</p>

<p>
	You have been told to ask the Holy Spirit for the answer to
	any specific problem, and that you will receive a specific
	answer if such is your need. You have also been told that there is
	only one problem and one answer. In prayer this is not
	contradictory. There are decisions to make here, and they must be
	made whether they be illusions or not. You cannot be asked to
	accept answers which are beyond the level of need that you
	recognise. Therefore it is not the form of the question that matters,
	nor how it is asked. The form of the answer, if given by God
	through His Voice, will suit your need as you see it. This is merely
	an echo of the reply of His Voice. The real sound is always a song of
	thanksgiving and love.
</p>

<p>
	We cannot, then, ask for the echo. It is the song that is the
	gift. Along with it come the overtones, the harmonics, the echoes,
	but these are secondary. In true prayer you hear only the song. All
	the rest is merely added. You have sought first the Kingdom of
	Heaven, and all else has indeed been given you.
</p>

<p>
	The secret of true prayer is to forget the things you think
	you need. To ask for the specific is much the same as to look on sin
	and then forgive it. Also in the same way, in prayer you overlook
	your specific needs as you see them, and let them go into His
	hands. There they become your gifts to Him, for they tell Him that
	you would have no gods before Him; no Love but His. What
	could His Answer be but your remembrance of Him? Can this be
	traded for a bit of trifling advice about a problem of an instantʹs
	duration? God answers only for eternity. But still all little answers
	are contained in this.
</p>

<p>
	Prayer is a stepping aside; a letting go; a quiet time of
	listening and loving. It should not be confused with supplication of
	any kind, because it is a way of remembering your holiness. Why
	should holiness entreat, being fully entitled to everything love has
	to offer? And it is to Love one goes in prayer. Prayer is an
	offering; a giving up of oneself to be at one with Love. There is
	nothing to ask because there is nothing left to want. That
	nothingness becomes the altar of God. It disappears in Him.
</p>

<p>
	This is not a level of prayer that everyone can attain as yet.
	Those who have not need your help in prayer because their asking
	is not yet based upon acceptance. Help in prayer does not mean
	that another mediates between you and God. But it does mean that
	another can stand beside you and help to raise you up to Him.
	One who has realised the goodness of God prays without fear. And
	one who prays without fear cannot but reach Him. He can therefore
	also reach His Son, wherever he may be and whatever form he may
	seem to take.
</p>

<p>
	Praying to Christ in anyone is true prayer because it is a gift
	of thanks to his Father. To ask that Christ be but Himself is not an
	entreaty but it <em>is</em> a song of thanksgiving for what you are. Hereïn
	lies the power of prayer. It asks nothing and receives everything.
	This prayer can be shared because it receives for everyone. To pray
	with one who knows that this is true is to be answered. Perhaps the
	specific form of solution for a specific problem will occur to either
	of you; it does not matter which. Perhaps it will reach both, if you
	are genuinely attuned to one another. It will come because you
	have realised that it does not matter. Thereïn lies its only truth.
</p>

<h2 id="c">C. The Ladder of Prayer</h2>

<p>
	Prayer has no beginning and no end. It is a part of life. But
	it does change in form, and grows with learning until it reaches its
	formless state, and fuses into total communication with God. In its
	asking form it need not, and often does not, make appeal to God, or
	even involve belief in Him. At that level prayer is merely wanting,
	out of a sense of scarcity and lack.
</p>

<p>
	The prayer, or asking‐out‐of‐need, always involves
	feelings of weakness and inadequacy, and could never be made by a
	Son of God who knows Who he is. Noöne, then, who is sure of his
	Identity could pray in this form. Yet it is also true that noöne who
	is uncertain of his Identity could avoid praying in this way. And
	prayer is as continual as life. Everyone prays without ceasing.
	Ask and you have received, for you have established what it is
	you want.
</p>

<p>
	It is also possible to reach a higher form of asking‐out‐of‐need,
	for in this world prayer must be used for reparation, and so
	it must entail levels of learning. Here, the asking may be addressed
	to God in honest belief, though not yet with understanding. A
	vague and usually unstable sense of identification has generally
	been reached, but it tends to be blurred by a deep‐rooted sense of
	sin. It is possible at this level to continue to ask for things of this
	world in various forms, but it is also possible to ask for qualities
	such as honesty or goodness, and particularly for forgiveness for the
	many sources of guilt that inevitably underlie any prayer of need.
	Without guilt there is no scarcity. The sinless have no needs.
</p>

<p>
	At this level also comes that curious contradiction in terms
	known as ‘praying for oneʹs enemies’. The contradiction lies not in
	the actual words, but in the way they are usually interpreted.
	While you believe you have enemies, you have limited prayer to the
	laws of this world, and limited your ability to receive and accept
	to the same narrow margins. And yet, if you have enemies you
	have need of prayer, and great need, too. What does the phrase
	really mean? Pray for yourself, that you may not seek to imprison
	Christ and thereby lose the recognition of your own Identity. Be
	traitor to noöne, or you will be treacherous to yourself. An enemy
	is the symbol for an imprisoned Christ. And who could He be
	except yourself?
</p>

<p>
	The prayer for enemies thus becomes a prayer for your own
	freedom. Now it is no longer a contradiction in terms. Rather it is
	a statement of the unity of Christ and a recognition of His
	sinlessness. And now it has become holy, for it acknowledges the
	Son of God as he was created.
</p>

<p>
	Let it never be forgotten that prayer at any level is always
	for yourself. If you unite with anyone in prayer, you make him part
	of you. The enemy is you, as is the Christ. Before it can become
	holy, then, prayer becomes a choice. You do not choose for another.
	You can but choose for yourself. Pray truly for your enemies,
	then, for hereïn lies your own salvation. Forgive them for your sins,
	and you will be forgiven indeed.
</p>

<p>
	Prayer is a ladder reaching up to Heaven. At the top there
	is a transformation much like your own, for prayer is part of you.
	The things of earth are left behind, all unremembered. There is no
	asking, for there is no lack. Identity in Christ is fully recognised as
	set forever, beyond all change and incorruptible. The light no
	longer flickers, and will never go out.
</p>

<p>
	Now, without needs of any kind, and clad forever in the
	pure sinlessness which is the gift of God to you, His Son, prayer
	can again become what it was meant to be. For now it rises as a
	song of thanks to your Creator, sung without words, or thoughts, or
	vain desires, unneedful now of anything at all. So it extends, as it
	was meant to do. And for this giving God Himself gives thanks.
</p>

<p>
	God is the goal of every prayer, giving it timelessness
	instead of end. Nor has it a beginning, because the goal has never
	changed. Prayer in its earlier forms is an illusion, because there is
	no need for a ladder to reach what one has never left. Yet prayer is
	part of forgiveness as long as forgiveness, itself an illusion, remains
	unattained. Prayer is tied up with learning until the goal of learning
	has been reached. And then all things will be transformed together,
	and returned unblemished into the Mind of God.
</p>

<p>
	Being beyond learning, this state cannot be described. The
	stages necessary to its attainment, however, need to be understood,
	if peace is to be restored to the Son of God, who lives now with the
	illusion of death and the fear of God.
</p>

<h2 id="d">D. Praying for Others</h2>

<p>
	We said that prayer is always for yourself, and this is true.
	Why, then, should you pray for others at all? And if you should,
	how should you do it? Praying for others, if rightly understood,
	becomes a means for lifting your projections of guilt from your
	brother, and enabling you to recognise it is not he who is hurting
	you. The poisonous thought that he <em>is</em> your enemy, your evil
	counterpart, your nemesis, must be relinquished before <em>you</em> can be
	saved from guilt. For this the means is prayer, of rising power and
	with ascending goals, until it reaches even up to God.
</p>

<p>
	The earlier forms of prayer, at the bottom of the ladder, will
	not be free from envy and even malice. They call for vengeance,
	not for love. Nor do they come from one who understands that they
	are calls for death, made out of fear by those who cherish guilt.
	They call upon a vengeful god, and it is he who seems to answer
	them. Hell cannot be asked for another, and then escaped by him
	who asks for this. Only those who are in hell can ask for hell.
	Those who have been forgiven, and who have accepted their
	forgiveness, could never make a prayer like this.
</p>

<p>
	At this level, then, the learning goal must be to recognise
	that prayer will bring an answer only in the form in which the
	prayer was made. This is enough. From here it will be an easy step
	to the next level. It begins with this:
</p>

<blockquote>
“What I have asked for for my brother is not what I would have. Thus
have I made of him my enemy.”
</blockquote>

<p>
	It is apparent that this step cannot be reached by anyone
	who sees no value nor advantage to himself in setting others free.
	This may be long delayed, because this step may seem to be
	dangerous instead of merciful. To the guilty there seems indeed to
	be a real advantage in having enemies, and this imagined gain
	must go, if enemies are to be set free. Guilt must be given up, and
	not concealed. Nor can it be without some pain, and a glimpse of
	the merciful nature of this step may for some time be followed by a
	deep retreat into fear. For fearʹs defences are fearful in themselves,
	and when they are recognised they bring their fear with them.
</p>

<p>
	Yet what advantage has an illusion of escape ever brought a
	prisoner? His real escape from guilt can lie only in the recognition
	that the guilt has gone. And how can this be recognised as long as
	he hides it in another, and does not see it as his own? Fear of escape
	makes it difficult to welcome freedom, and to make a jailer of an
	enemy seems to be safety. How, then, can he be released without an
	insane fear for yourself? You have made of him your salvation and
	your escape from guilt. Your investment in this escape is
	heavy, and your fear of letting go is strong.
</p>

<p>
	Stand still an instant, now, and think what you have done.
	Do not forget that it is you who did it, and who can therefore let it
	go. Hold out your hand; this enemy has come to bless you. Take
	his blessing and feel how your heart is lifted and your fear released.
	Do not hold on to it, nor onto him. He is a Son of God, along with
	you. He is no jailer, but a messenger of Christ. Be this to him, that
	you may see him thus.
</p>

<p>
	It is not easy to realise that prayers for things, for status,
	for external ‘gifts’ of any kind, are always made to set up jailers
	and to hide from guilt. Yet these things, too, are used for goals
	that substitute for God, and therefore distort the purpose of prayer.
	The desire for them <em>is</em> the prayer. One need not ask explicitly. The
	goal of God is lost in the quest for lesser goals of any kind, and
	prayer becomes requests for enemies. The power of prayer can be
	quite clearly recognised even in this. Noöne who wants an enemy
	will fail to find one. But just as surely will he lose the only true goal
	that is given him. Think of the cost, and understand it well. All
	other goals are at the cost of God.
</p>

<h2 id="e">E. Praying with Others</h2>

<p>
	Until the second step at least begins, one cannot share in
	prayer, for until that point, each one must ask for different things.
	But once the need to hold the other as an enemy has been
	questioned, and the reason has been recognised if only for an
	instant, it becomes possible to join in prayer. Enemies do not share
	a goal, and it is here their enmity is kept. Their separate wishes are
	their arsenals; their fortresses in hate. The key to rising further still
	in prayer lies in this simple thought; this change of mind:
/p>

<blockquote>
We go together, you and I.
</blockquote>

<p>
	Now it is possible to help in prayer, and so reach up
	yourself. This step begins the quicker ascent, but there are still
	many lessons to learn. The way is open, and hope is justified. Yet
	it is likely at first that what is asked for even by those who join in
	prayer is not the goal that prayer should truly seek. Even
	together they may ask for things, and thus set up but an illusion of
	a goal they share. They may ask together for specifics, and not
	realize that they are asking for effects without the cause. And this
	they cannot have. For no‐one can receive effects alone, and
	choose a cause from which they do not come to offer them to him.
	Even the joining, then, is not enough, if those who pray together do
	not ask, before all else, what is the Will of God. From this Cause
	only can the Answer come in which are all specifics satisfied; all
	separate wishes unified in one.
</p>

<p>
	Prayers for specifics always ask to have the past repeated
	in some way. What was enjoyed before, or seemed to be, — what
	was anotherʹs and he seemed to like, — all these are but illusions
	from the past. The aim of prayer is to release the present from its
	chains of past illusions; to let it be a freely chosen remedy from
	every choice that stood for a mistake. What prayer can offer now so
	far exceeds all that you asked before that it is pitiful to be content
	with less.
</p>

<p>
	You have a newborn‐chance each time you pray. And
	would you stifle and imprison it in ancient prisons, when the chance
	has come to free yourself from all of them at once? Do not restrict
	your asking. Prayer can bring the peace of God. What time‐bound
	thing can give you more than this, in just the little space that lasts
	until it crumbles into dust?
</p>

<h2 id="f">F. The Ladder Ends</h2>

<p>
	Prayer is a way to true humility. But here again it rises
	up, slowly at first, and grows in strength and love and holiness.
	Let it but leave the ground where it begins to rise to God, and true
	humility will come at last to grace the mind that thought it was
	alone and stood against the world. Humility brings peace because it
	does not claim that you must rule the universe, nor judge all
	things as you would have them be. All little gods it gladly lays
	aside, not in resentment, but in honesty and recognition that they
	did not serve.
</p>

<p>
	Illusions and humility have goals so far apart they cannot
	coëxist, nor share a dwelling place. Where one has come the
	other disappears. The truly humble have no goal but God because
	they need no idols, and defence no longer has a purpose. Enemies
	are useless now, because humility does not oppose. It does not hide
	in shame because it is content with what it is, knowing creation is
	the Will of God. Its selflessness is Self, and this it sees in every
	meeting, where it gladly joins with every Son of God, whose purity
	it recognises that it shares with him. Now prayer is lifted from the
	world of things, of bodies, and of gods of every kind, and you can
	rest in holiness at last. Humility has taught you how to
	understand your glory as Godʹs Son, and recognise the arrogance of
	sin. A dream has veiled the face of Christ from you. Now can you
	look upon His sinlessness.
</p>

<p>
	High has the ladder risen. You have come almost to
	Heaven. There is little more to learn before the journey is complete.
	Now you say to everyone who joins in prayer with you:
</p>

<blockquote>
“I cannot go without you, for you are a part of me”.
</blockquote>

<p>
And so he is in truth. Now must you pray only for what you truly
share with him. For you have understood he never left, and you,
who seemed alone, are one with him.
</p>

<p>
	The ladder ends with this, for learning is no longer needed.
	Now you stand before the gate of Heaven, and your brother stands
	beside you there. The lawns are deep and still, for here the place
	appointed for the time when you should come has waited long for
	you. Here will time end forever. At this gate eternity itself will join
	with you. Prayer has become what it was meant to be, for you have
	recognised the Christ in you.
</p>
